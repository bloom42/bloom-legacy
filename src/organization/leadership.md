# Leadership

Clear leadership is what gives Bloom an edge over it's competitors, buried under tons of bureaucracy.

[Sylvain Kerkour](https://www.kerkour.fr/about/) is the undisputed (Benevolent) dictator for life of the
Bloom organization. He has all rights within this organization. Being an human he also has flaws and you should deal with it.

By being [INTJ](https://www.16personalities.com/intj-personality) his sens of focus is really intense.
He may not respond to you because it does not find what you say intersting enough.
