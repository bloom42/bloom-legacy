It's been 6 months since <a href="/blog/bloom-a-free-and-open-source-google" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bloom launched</a>.
6 incredible months with a lot of sweat and some sleepless nights.

But something even more incredible is coming during the next months: The launch of Bloom's native applications
featuring among other things end to end encryption and offline support.

## From cloud to local first

*Cloud apps like Google Docs and Trello are popular because they enable real-time collaboration with colleagues, and they make it easy for us to access our work from all of our devices. However, by centralizing data storage on servers, cloud apps also take away ownership and agency from users. If a service shuts down, the software stops functioning, and data created with that software is lost.* from [InkAndSwitch](https://www.inkandswitch.com/local-first.html).

But first of all, cloud is a business model. Cloud's first objective is not to empower users, but to
created recuring revenue streams for enterprises (and investors).

What happen to users' data if the
enterprise go bakrupt? If the enteprise decides to kill the product because it's not enough profitable?
If the enterprise's cloud get hacked? If an embargo is set? If internet is cut for some days/weeks?
